# Circus Flutter Coding Challenge

This app represents the coding challenge for Flutter engineers applying at [Circus Group](https://www.circus-group.com/).

## Assignment
This app shows a list of dishes on the main screen. A dummy API provides these dishes. Your task will be to extend this app and add some additional features. This challenge is intended to take 3-4 hours maximum. 

## Tasks
1. Read through this documentation.
2. Get familiar with the code.
3. Add the ability to put products into a basket. 
   * Adding products multiple times should be possible.
   * (Optional:) Respect the `max_basket_count` field in the server response.
4. Add a screen showing the content of the basket.
5. (Optional:) Allow adding and removing items from the basket screen.
6. Make your solution available on GitHub in a **private** repository.
7. Invite [t-unit](https://github.com/t-unit) to the repository and let us know via email that you completed the challenge.

## Notes
* You can add/use any package available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/)
* We don't expect any fancy design. Feel free to use any widgets you find suitable.
* Try to follow the style and architecture of the existing code as much as possible.
* There is no need to persist the basket. Keeping it in memory during the runtime of the app is fine.
* Your solution should meet best practices and standards.
* There should be no need to change existing classes in the data folder. (But you might want to add new classes.)
* How you implement the challenge is more important than the number of features or time you put into it.
* This project does not contain any tests. This does not mean we don't value tests in our production, nor does it mean you should not add any tests for your code.

If you have any questions, please let us know. Have fun and happy coding!
